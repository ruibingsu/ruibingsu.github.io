    <p>Hello! I'm Ruibing Su. I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Maryland, College Park. I earned my bachelor's degrees in Space Science and Engineering and Economics from Peking University in 2018, followed by a master's degree in Economics at the same university in 2021 (PKUer&times;2).</p>
    <p>My research primarily revolves around Industrial Organization and Econometrics, with a specific focus on retail markets, advertising, and the use of machine learning for causal inference and structural modeling.</p>
