    <p>Hello! I'm Ruibing Su. I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Maryland, College Park. I earned my bachelor's degrees in Space Science and Engineering and Economics from Peking University in 2018, followed by a master's degree in Economics at the same university in 2021 (PKUer&times;2).</p>
    <p>My research primarily revolves around Industrial Organization and Econometrics, with a specific focus on retail markets, advertising, and the use of machine learning for causal inference and structural modeling.</p>

    <p><strong>Private Equity Buyouts: A Study of the US Ketchup Industry </strong></p>
     <p>Abstract: Do PE buyouts improve acquired firms’ performance? In this paper, I investigate the effect of PE buyouts in the ketchup industry, leveraging large-scale Kilts Nielsen databases that detail consumer purchases and advertising. Focusing on the acquisition of Heinz by 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway, I document the increase in Heinz’s retailer prices and advertising following the acquisition. Using a random coefficient logit model, I recover the marginal costs for Heinz and its major competitor under a Nash-Bertrand equilibrium. Then, I evaluate the impact of the buyout on Heinz’s marginal costs through a DiD method, and my results reveal that the buyout increased Heinz’s marginal costs by 15%.</p>
