Hello! I'm Ruibing Su, a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Maryland, College Park. I earned my bachelor's degrees in Space Science and Engineering and Economics from Peking University in 2018, followed by a master's degree in Economics at the same university in 2021 (PKU$$\times$$2). My research primarily revolves around Industrial Organization and Econometrics, with a specific focus on retail markets, advertising, and the use of machine learning for causal inference and structural modeling.
