    <p>Hello! I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Maryland, College Park. I earned my bachelor's degrees in Space Science and Engineering and Economics from Peking University in 2018, followed by a master's degree in Economics at the same university in 2021 (PKUer&times;2).</p>
    <p>My research primarily revolves around Industrial Organization and Econometrics, with a specific focus on retail markets, advertising, and the use of machine learning for causal inference and structural modeling.</p>

    <p><strong><b>Private Equity Buyouts: A Study of the US Ketchup Industry</b></strong></p>
    <p>Abstract: Do PE buyouts improve acquired firms’ performance? In this paper, I investigate the effect of PE buyouts in the ketchup industry. Focusing on the buyout of Heinz by 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway, I document the increase in Heinz’s prices and advertising following the buyout. Using a random coefficients logit model, I recover the marginal costs for Heinz and its major competitors under a Nash-Bertrand equilibrium. Then, I investigate the impact of the buyout on Heinz’s marginal costs through an event study method, and my results reveal that the buyout increased Heinz’s marginal costs by 19%, primarily due to the closure of one of Heinz's largest plants in North America. Utilizing the estimated model, I conducted a counterfactual simulation where Heinz's marginal costs are not affected by the buyout. The simulation results indicate that the buyout led to a 18% decrease in consumer surplus..</p>
